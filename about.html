    <p1>One letter that would decsibe me is letter <em>M</em> i like moving things like an attorney general.
        Sounds funny haa!But its a reality.Mary is the first born of two kids born in Mombasa but raised in Nakuru.
        she has dream of becoming one of the best female app developers in the world.This tells you why i choose to school at Moringa school to sharpen my skills and shape 
        my career.</p1>
     <p2 >Another thing about me is that i just love thinking.I guess i should that is my hubby. If aint doing 
         anything that is engaging my mind then i must be thing. Wondering what i think? Well there are so maany 
         things that run my mind.First beeing new inventions, one of the mojor reasons i decided to take this course
         is because of that. I might think of something, perhaps i have never heard of it only google some 
         still exists while some not yet.

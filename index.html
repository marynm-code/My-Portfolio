          My Hobby
        </a>
        This <e>project</e>shows i love doing during my free time. Cycling is one of
        the most exciting thing that you can ever learn. Through my cycling
        journey i have meant a lot of people who also love doing it. Well i can
        say Sport is great. It opens the door to new relationships, teaches you
        discipline, keeps you healthy and in general is a very productive way to
        spend one’s time. But, sometimes, sport can be tough; physically and
        mentally). It can disrupt relationships, cost a lot of money and cause
        you to become very “one-dimensional” in your life. I’ve participated in
        a few sports over the years. But my main hobby, passion and competitive
        Pursuit is cycling. When I started cycling I was a complete fresher. 
        My family had no history in cycling; I didn’t know
        where to start. I was afraid to wear lycra and in general had no real
        guiding hand to show me what to do. This blog post is going to be a sort
        of self-reflection or journey into the mistakes we make as we’re
        beginning, what they teach us and how we can learn from them. Here’s 5
        things I wish I’d known when I started cycling (or any sport really).

          >My Pet Website</a
        >
        This website is one of the most exciting projects so far. I wrote it
        barely a week old in programming. Through this project i have lots of
        staff and and i know they will be of help in my future projects. As time
        goes by i keep learning the need to go an extra mile to make sure i
        archive all that is needed for that particular day. So far i have used
        Html and css to create this website. Hopefully things will get more
        exciting.
